ToDo:
        - ability to show/hide players/teams depending on their attributes,
          points etc.. by comparing them against user settable values.
          (bigger,smaller,equal and unequal)
        - view team totals (goals, points, assists etc..)
        - reprogram very stupid line editor tables with much easier and
          simpler solution
