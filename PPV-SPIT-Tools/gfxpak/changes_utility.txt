         - converts NHL'96 (TGV), NHL'97 (TGQ), some NHL'98 (DCT) and
           NHL'99 (MAD) movies' sounds to WAV format. Unfortunately I was
           forced to add manual decoder selection because I couldn't find
           a way to separate NHL'99 movies' sounds from other soundfiles.
         - supports old ASF format from Need for Speed

01.04.99 - GFXPAK 0.41
	 - experimental small face generator. Clips and scales big face
	   image (Lxxxx) and creates small face (Sxxxx) automatically.
	 - some changes to auto transparency algorithm. Remember to use
	   -notrans if your image does not have any transparent areas
	   and gfxpak seems to change some colors strangely..
	 - -face understand more image formats than png and pcx..
	 - GFX.DLL 0.62
	 - parent directory added to directory list ("..")
	 - SHIFT+'C' changes to C-drive SHIFT+'D' to D-drive etc..

	 - some changes to palette file loading

16.11.98 - GFX.DLL 0.60 (Fullscreen viewer is still experimental!)

	   resolution and color depth. Use mouse or cursor keys to scroll
	   screen if image is bigger than selected resolution

	 - much faster resizing algorithm
	 - directories are shown first in file/directory listing
	 - GFXUTILS
	 - JPEG support (read-only)

03.10.98 - GFX.DLL 0.50
	 - better cursor positioning after backspace/return
	 - /gfx parameter works slightly differently and is not normally
	   anymore needed (Because of game selector screen). /gfx = go
	   directly to GFX.DLL without game selector, /nogfx = don't
	   "detect" GFX.DLL at all
	 - change directory command ('D'-key)
	 - stack image command ('O'-key) (Useful for viewing images that
	   are divided in three pieces)
	 - image replace support. Much easier and intuitive than GFXPAK
	 - most memory leaks fixed, but there is still one memory leak left
	   that eats 700KB of memory / replaced image. Restarting NHLINFO
	   frees all leaked memory

13.08.98 - GFXPAK 0.35
	 - recompiled with correct settings. Should work now

	   works now correctly but didn't work with older GFXPAK.
	 - fixed 0x78 (15-bit RGB) SHPI-image (World Cup 98)

27.04.98 - GFXPAK 0.28
	 - -p parameter didn't work correctly with multiple files
	 - adding new entries didn't work
	   (gfxpak -c shpifile newshpifile newimage newshpi oldshpi)

20.04.98 - GFXPAK 0.27
	 - GFXPAK didn't always 10FB-fakecompress files, fixed.

15.04.98 - GFXVIEW 0.32 GFXPAK 0.26
	 - new palette types implemented (many NBA Live'98 and Triple
	   Play'99 images are now correct)
	 - -r(p) parameter implemented (combined -c(p) and -p)
	 - -p parameter internal changes, also new pack file header is
	   identical to original.
	 - if you have problems with GFXPAK (game crashing etc..) first
	   replace modified files from game CD with original files and
	   then replace images again. Contact me if you still have problems.

	 - new fsh-file's directory is not anymore sorted

26.03.98 - GFXVIEW 0.31 GFXPAK 0.23
	 - AGAIN! Removed palette matching bug. Caused random wrong colors
	   when 'palette changed, matching..' text was output
	   (It begins to look it is nearly impossible to remove all
	   palette matching bugs....)
	 - added support for new SHPI images and palette (found from Triple
	   Play'99 demo) (Currently GFXVIEW only, full GFXPAK support is
	   implemented later)
	 - GFXVIEW probably looks now very bad with 256 color desktop
	 - WARNING: GFXVIEW /fullscreen may not work very well
	 - T-key can be used to check transparency
	 - background transparency works with -c parameter
	 - SHPI-names' case is now automatically preserved when replacing
	   images

	 - again GFX-import palette fixes

18.01.98 - GFXVIEW 0.25 GFXPAK 0.13
